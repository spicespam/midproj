                <b>About Myself</b>
                <p>I am 17 years old, my birthday is on the 23rd of October, and I've been in Silliman since childhood.
                    I have been around computers since I was a baby and I've used them since before I could read.
                    I have a lot of love for the technological capabilities of today as a result. I have occasionally
                    been out of the country, and had to go to school in the US for those times, which included the
                    pandemic.
                    I returned home and have been going to school here once again ever since. For my hobbies, I like to
                    code, draw, and play games.
                    I also like to make and listen to music. When it comes to music, my favorite genre is classic rock
                    (I love the Beatles), but I really enjoy listening to anything.
