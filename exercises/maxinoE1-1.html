		<h2>About Myself</h2>
		<p>I am 17 years old, my birthday is on the 23rd of October, and I've been in Silliman since childhood.
		I have been around computers since I was a baby and I've used them since before I could read.<br>
		I have a lot of love for the technological capabilities of today as a result. I have occasionally been out of the country, and had to go to school in the US for those times, which included the pandemic. <br>
		I returned home and have been going to school here once again ever since. For my hobbies, I like to code, draw, and play games.
		I also like to make and listen to music.<br>When it comes to music, my favorite genre is classic rock (I love the Beatles), but I really enjoy listening to anything.
		</p>

		<p>Course: BS Computer Science</p>
		<p>Year Level: 1</p>
		<p>Subjects enrolled: CCS1, CCS2, PSLF, CHS 1, GE4, GE10, PE 1, PEP 1, NSTP (LTS)</p>
		
		<h2>My Goal</h2>
